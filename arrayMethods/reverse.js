// In JavaScript, the reverse method is used to reverse the elements of an array. It mutates the array in place, meaning it modifies the original array without creating a new one. Here's the syntax and a short description:
// Syntax array.reverse()

var names = ["Rahul", "Sonam", "Sumit",'abc'];
 console.log(names.reverse())
